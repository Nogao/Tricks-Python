# Tricks-Python
Just a repo for my personal entertainment 👀


If you want to see how it works:

## 1️⃣Clone this repo
Open it on your IDE (Atom or Sublim text)

## 2️⃣BANG
Now if you are on Atom read this, if you are on Sublim Text scroll (I talk about it after)



#### On Atom, you have to install 'Script' package

MAC: Command⌘ + Shift⇧ + P
Windows: Alt + Shift + P

Write: View installed packages

Now, on left click on "+ Install"
Write: 'Script'
Install it

#### Restart Atom on the code

and now you can run Python on your Atom with: 
MAC: Command⌘ + I
Windows(I hope): Alt + I (try with Ctrl if Alt don't work)



#### On Sublim text

Run it with:
MAC: Command⌘ + B
Windows(I hope): Alt + B (try with Ctrl if Alt don't work)
